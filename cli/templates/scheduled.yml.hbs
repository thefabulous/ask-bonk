            Update all dependencies to their latest compatible versions.

            Steps:
            1. Run the appropriate update command for this project's package manager
            2. Run tests to verify nothing is broken
            3. Run type checking if applicable

            Create a summary listing each updated package with its old and new version,
            ranked by severity (major > minor > patch).

            If any tests fail after updating, identify the problematic package and
            exclude it from the update, noting it in the PR description.
