Just `/bonk` it.

It's a code (and docs!) review agent that responds to mentions in issues and PRs. Built on [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode), Bonk can review code, answer questions about your codebase, and make changes directly by opening PRs and telling you where you can do better.

- **Code & doc review** - Get feedback on PRs, explain code, or ask questions about your repo just by mentioning `/bonk` in an issue, PR comment or even line comments.
- **Make changes** - Bonk can edit files and create PRs from issues and update PRs.
- **Fully configurable** - Supports any [model provider](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers) that OpenCode does (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.). Why reinvent the wheel when there's a perfectly round one already?

## Quick Start

1. Install the [ask-bonk GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk) on your repository
2. Add `OPENCODE_API_KEY` to your repository secrets (**Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**) - [get one here](https://opencode.ai/api-keys)
3. Mention `@ask-bonk` or `/bonk` in any issue or PR

On first mention, Bonk will create a PR to add the workflow file to your repo.

### Using Other Providers

[Any OpenCode provider](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/) is supported. Update your `bonk.yml` workflow file to specify a different model and pass the appropriate API key:

```yaml
      - name: Run Bonk
        uses: sst/opencode/github@dev
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        with:
          model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

## Usage

Mention the bot in any issue or PR:

```
@ask-bonk fix the type error in utils.ts
```

Or use the slash command:

```
/bonk add tests for the auth module
```

### Examples

- `@ask-bonk review this PR` - Get a code review
- `/bonk explain how the auth system works` - Ask questions about the codebase
- `@ask-bonk fix the failing tests` - Let Bonk make changes and push commits
- `/bonk add documentation for the API endpoints` - Generate documentation

### Events

Bonk can respond to the following GitHub webhook events:

| Event | Action | Trigger | Description |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `issue_comment` | `created` | `/bonk` or `@ask-bonk` in comment body | Responds to mentions in issue and PR comments |
| `pull_request_review_comment` | `created` | `/bonk` or `@ask-bonk` in comment body | Responds to mentions in PR line comments (with diff context) |
| `issues` | `opened` | New issue created | Automatically responds to newly opened issues (workflow mode only) |
| `issues` | `edited` | Issue body edited | Only triggers if body contains `/bonk`/`@ask-bonk` OR body changed 20%+ |
| `schedule` | — | Cron expression in workflow | Runs automated tasks on a schedule (prompt via workflow file) |
| `workflow_dispatch` | — | Manual workflow trigger | Runs tasks manually via Actions UI (prompt via workflow file) |

**Event Categories:**
- **User-driven events** (`issue_comment`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `issues`): Triggered by user actions. Require write access check. Add reactions to acknowledge.
- **Repo-driven events** (`schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`): Triggered by repository automation. No actor to check permissions for. Prompt comes from workflow file.

#### Scheduled Tasks

Scheduled events use the `prompt` input in your workflow file:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 4 * * 5"  # Friday at 4AM UTC

jobs:
  update-deps:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: sst/opencode/github@dev
        env:
          OPENCODE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENCODE_API_KEY }}
        with:
          model: opencode/claude-opus-4-5
          oidc_base_url: "https://ask-bonk.silverlock.workers.dev/auth"
          prompt: |
            Update all dependencies to their latest compatible versions.
            Run tests and type-check after updating.
```
