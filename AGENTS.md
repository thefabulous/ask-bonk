# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents working on ask-bonk.

## Project Overview

ask-bonk is a GitHub code review bot built on OpenCode. It responds to `/bonk` or `@ask-bonk` mentions in issues and PRs, running in a Cloudflare Workers environment with Durable Objects.

## Package Manager

**Use `bun` for all package management and script execution.**

- Install dependencies: `bun install`
- Run tests: `bun run test` (vitest)
- Type check: `bun run tsc --noEmit`
- Deploy: `bun run deploy` (wrangler)

Do NOT use npm, yarn, or pnpm.

## Tech Stack

- Runtime: Cloudflare Workers
- Framework: Hono
- Language: TypeScript
- Testing: Vitest with `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`
- GitHub API: Octokit (REST and GraphQL)
- Sandbox: `@cloudflare/sandbox` for OpenCode execution

## Project Structure

```

## Code Conventions

1. Keep related functionality together - avoid excessive file splitting
2. External API functions (GitHub, Sandbox) stay in their respective files
3. Comments explain "why", not "what" - skip comments on short functions
4. Prefer JSONC for configuration files
5. Minimize new dependencies

## Testing

Run tests with `bun run test`. Tests focus on:
- Webhook event parsing and validation
- API interface correctness
- Error handling and crash resistance

## Key Patterns

- Octokit uses the retry plugin for automatic 5xx error retry
- GraphQL is used for fetching issue/PR context with comments
- Webhook signature verification via `@octokit/webhooks`
- Sandbox executes OpenCode in isolated environment with git access

## Operation Modes

The bot has two endpoints with different execution models:

### `/webhooks` - GitHub Actions Workflow Mode
All webhook events (issue comments, PR review comments, issues, schedule, workflow_dispatch) trigger GitHub Actions workflows. OpenCode runs inside the workflow, not in Bonk's infrastructure. The RepoAgent Durable Object tracks workflow run status and posts failure comments if needed.

### `/ask` - Direct Sandbox Mode
The `/ask` endpoint runs OpenCode directly in Cloudflare Sandbox for programmatic API access. Requires bearer auth (`ASK_SECRET`). Returns SSE stream with session events.
